- November 1st, 2020 (0.0.5): Koishie is now a stalker! Just kidding, she helps you track your activities on your browser, i.e. how many time you spend on specific websites (configure your web store at `data/util_data.json`). Then, you can ask her to visualize your activities based on your requests.
- October 9th, 2020 (0.0.4): Koishie is now an interpreter (probably)! If you want to learn new words from different languages, just ask Koishie. She will tell you how to write those words, as well as how to pronounce them!
- October 2nd, 2020 (0.0.3): Koishie can now take selfies! Wait, not just ordinary selfies, but only selfie of you smiling. If you are not sure how to smile properly, Koishie is there to help you. Else, show Koishie your brightest smile!
WARNING: I still haven't found a way to make dlib easy to install on Windows, use this function at your own risk.
- October 1st, 2020 (0.0.2): Restructuring the project and adding local admin function to add future websites or greetings scripts.
- Aug 13th, 2020 (0.0.1): Koishie can now play music! Thanks to Youtube API v3, Koishie is able to search for any song at your request. (Still some minor bugs in pausing and stopping and very limited daily search count)
To use this function, go to `music.py` and change `[YOUR_API_KEY]` to your own Google Cloud API Key. More at [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys)
